As users of the world wide web, we should use strong passwords consisting of 
special chars, numbers and lower & uppercase letters. But who can rememberÂ´those 
strong passwords? *Nobody*
##Safe Solution
Imagine you want to *check your emails* in an internet cafe. You don't trust the 
Computer, so opening a software-password-safe like Keepass is risky. This device 
stores *all your passwords* encrypted by a strong algorithm (AES).
